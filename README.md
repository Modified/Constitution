Constitution: a Software Engineering Manifesto for Web Apps
==============================================================

Constitution is a high level platform for bleeding edge web applications development done right!
It's an opinionated framework and methodology built upon radical technologies: CoffeeScript, Socket.IO, LevelDB, Cake, Double Macchiato, Flexbox… Docker?

In other words, it's a defense system against the MVC/OOP idiocracy plaguing the web technologies ecosystem as of late. There's a growing (counter-)movement — a resistance, avantgarde, awakening — documenting the horrors of this plague and advocating solutions.

Constitution aims to… offer a technological solution to a key challenge startups face, namely, lack of software engineering insight.

Key Features and Principles
---------------------------------

1. Domain specific languages: CoffeeScript, Stylus, Double Macchiato?
1. Dreamcode; opinionated; good magic vs bad magic
1. 12 Factors Manifesto
1. Scaffolding (skeletons)
1. Testing — or not

…
continuous delivery,
asset pipeline, feature toggling, auth, WYSIWYG/contenteditable

Roadmap?
-----------

1. Demo apps…
1. Express.IO (or Zappa?): adopt API, but upgrade deps…
